This is for Linkedin Live Events.

Go to events page go to share -> invite connections

Scroll down in the list so you have 100+ people that you can select to invite.

Press Command Option J (or go to View-> Developer -> Javascrip Console in Google Chrome) 

Copy Paste This script in the console > CODE



const elements = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(".artdeco-list.artdeco-typeahead__result.pv2.invitee-picker-connections-result-item--can-invite.ph5.relative.invitee-picker__result-item")).slice(0, 99);

elements.forEach(element => {
  element.click();
});


Press enter, it will put 99 connection in the invite list, if you scrolled down far enough, close the console. Hit the invite button.


BTW, The limit is capped 100 because between 100-130 LinkedIn itself crashes. 


P.S if you are the growth hacker working at Voyager, who put my code in your Linkedin API, I don't appreciate that. 
I don't mind that you use my code, but your have made my script temporarily inaccesable for everyone else.
Next time have at least have the decency to fork towards this script.

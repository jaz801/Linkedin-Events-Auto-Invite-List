This is for Linkedin Live Events.

Go to events page go to share -> invite connections

Scroll down in the list so you have 100+ people that you can select to invite.

Press Command Option J (or go to View-> Developer -> Javascrip Console in Google Chrome) 

Copy Paste This script in the console > CODE



const elements = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(".artdeco-list.artdeco-typeahead__result.pv2.invitee-picker-connections-result-item--can-invite.ph5.relative.invitee-picker__result-item")).slice(0, 99);

elements.forEach(element => {
  element.click();
});



Some growth hacker put my code in his Linkedin API, which is not available if you don't work ar Voyager.

So play around with the amount by changing the numbers in the splice function, 99 works at the moment 100 not.  

You do need click invite yourself, repeat until you have invited everybody.

In the future, I will add a loop that it goes through your entire list.  

BTW, The limit is capped 100 because between 100-130 LinkedIn itself crashes.

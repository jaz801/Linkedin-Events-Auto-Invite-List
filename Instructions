This is for Linkedin Live Events.

Go to events page go to share -> invite connections

Scroll down in the list so you have 100+ people that you can select to invite.

Press Command Option J (or go to View-> Developer -> Javascrip Console in Google Chrome) 

Copy Paste This script in the console > CODE



const elements = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(".artdeco-list.artdeco-typeahead__result.pv2.invitee-picker-connections-result-item--can-invite.ph5.relative.invitee-picker__result-item")).slice(0, 100);

elements.forEach(element => {
  element.click();
});




Press enter and it will select 100 people.

You do need click invite yourself, repeat until you have invited everybody.

In the future, I will add a loop that it goes through your entire list.  

BTW, The limit is capped 100 because between 100-130 LinkedIn itself crashes.
